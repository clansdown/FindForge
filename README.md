# MachineLearner AI Research Tool

A tool which helps to do research using LLMs. It uses openrouter.ai as its backend so you can choose almost any LLM that you want. This does require you to have an openrouter.ai key. The account is free but most LLMs aren't. You can, however, limit yourself to the free LLM providers (who mostly use the input as training data)

This is meant to be deployed to a static website and potentially installed as a PWA.
